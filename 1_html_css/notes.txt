HTML has 3 types of elemets:
1. block element – takes up the entire line
  Example – <p> <div>

  # To change to inline-block
  .video-author,
  .video-stats {
    display: inline-block;
  }

2. inline-block element – only takes as much space as it needs to
  Examples – <img> <input>


3. inline element – appear within a line of text
  Exampel – <strong>



Nested Layouts Technique:
1. vertical Layout _
                   _
                   _
2. horizontal layout |||

font-family: 2nd, 3rd and so on are backup fonts if the 1st one doesnt't load for some reason


For grid:
1fr means 1 free space, which takes up the remaining space
the number in front of it means how much relatively it takes up the space

For flexbox:
flex: 1; is the equvalent of 1fr

For position:
default position is static
position: fixed – element doesn't move with page scroll

For absolute position:
Differences with position: fixed:
fixed = placed in the browser window (doesn't move)
absolute = placed on the page (does move) (use to put things in corners of other things)

z-index = determines which elements appear
in front and which behind. Default is 0. Elements with
higher z index appear in front of elements with lower one

For relative position:
displays elemet as normal, except if we put abs element in it, it will
position itself relative to the first element instead relative of the page

Absolute position inside relative position

Font boldness:
400 – normal
500 – semi-bold
700 – bold


New type of selector
.sidebar-link img {}
this targets only images in .sidebar-link

white-space: nowrap – prevents the text from wrapping


/* CSS Shorthand properties 
  padding-left: 4px;
  padding-right: 4px;
  padding-bottom: 4px;
  padding-top: 4px; 
  
  is the same as

    padding: 4px - targets all;
    padding: 4px 10px – 4px targets top and bottom (vertical padding), 10px targets left and right (horizontal padding)
    padding: 4px 10px 20px 30px – top, right, bottom, left

  same for margin

  for border it is:
  border: width style color
*/

INHERITENCE:
if you set style for the outer elemet, it will get inherited down to the inner elemets
it mostly just works with text properties
not all properties are inherited: boder


SEMANTIC ELEMENTS:
<header></header>
<nav></nav> – navigation
<main></main> – contains main contents of the website
main can contain multiple <section></section> elements

work the same name as <div> but have special meanign to screen readings, seach engines, or any kind of device or robot that reads the website
it helps recognise the structure of the website correctly
