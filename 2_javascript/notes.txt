Escape character: \' is concidered a single character that counts as nothing

TEMPLATE STRINGS
`template string` allows to input values directly into a string
`Items (${1 + 1}): $${(2095 + 799) / 100}`

`some
text` creates 'some\ntext'

To put JavaScript in html we do the same as adding <style>, but instead of head it's put into <body>
<script></script>
it is put at the boddom of <body> because we want to create the website first and then use JS to make it interactive
